# My personal website!
This project is just simply my own personal website. nothing too special really.

## Why do it?
If we are being honest, I am really doing this for 2 major reasons
### 1st, for employers
I wanted a centralized location of all my skills and work. So that way if an employer (or anyone who wants to work with me for that matter) can look at one place to get a general idea of what skills I have under my belt.
### 2st, for a social outlet
I’ve grown tired of the modern day ‘social media outlet’, with twitter being the rare exception. But I still wanted an avenue to display/post whatever I am doing in my spare time. 

## What content will be displayed?
Generally speaking, I want to display the following content
* Skills
  * Others can see what skills I bring to the table
* Projects
  * others can see what things I have done and what I’m currently working on
  * allows people to see my workflow
  * allows others who are new to coding to get an idea of how to make such projects
* Personal Content
  * a blog area so I can show off my bad grammar skills!
  * shows off what my personality is like, allowing others to get an idea if i am a good fit for their team
* Contact
  * so, people can get in touch with me
